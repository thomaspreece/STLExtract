=head1 NAME

Math::PlanePath::Base::NSEW -- multi-inheritance mixin for North, South, East, West unit steps

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=for test_synopsis my @ISA; # normally a package variable of course, but this satisfies Test::Synopsis

 package Math::PlanePath::Foo;
 use Math::PlanePath;
 use Math::PlanePath::Base::NSEW;
 @ISA = ('Math::PlanePath::Base::NSEW', 'Math::PlanePath');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a multi-inheritance mixin for paths which take only steps North,
South, East and West by distance 1 each time.  This includes for example the
C<SquareSpiral> and also things like the C<DragonCurve> or C<CCurve>.

The following path descriptive methods are provided

                        value
    dx_minimum()         -1
    dx_maximum()          1
    dy_minimum()         -1
    dy_maximum()          1

    dsumxy_minimum()     -1
    dsumxy_maximum()      1
    ddiffxy_minimum()    -1
    ddiffxy_maximum()     1
    dir_maximum_dxdy()   0,-1    # maximum South

=cut

#    _UNDOCUMENTED__dxdy_list()          1,0, 0,1, -1,0, 0,-1
